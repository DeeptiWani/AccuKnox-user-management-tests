## Project Overview

This project automates the following user management test scenarios of the OrangeHRM Admin module, accessed at:

- **Login URL:** https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login  
- **Admin Module URL:** https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/admin/viewSystemUsers  

Tests include login verification, adding users, form validations, searching users, and more. All test cases are implemented as individual `test` blocks using Playwright’s POM pattern, ensuring clean and reusable code.
